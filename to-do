So, it could be a separate tab (SSL Domains), or the check-box as mentioned above.

I also think consolidating the "Add domain" and "Remove Domain" tabs could be consolidated with a multi-select radio button and action (delete), with an "add domain" button that pops up 
    a window with a field that allows multiple line-separated domains.

We'll also need a parser for the PEM file to, at a minimum, check for the appropriate BEGIN and END lines in the correct order within the PEM file before posting.

Also within domain edit, the check-boxes should be toggles and not single entry, so that for example, multiple domains can be deleted or purged.


Hi Jeremiah,

I have one more fix-up for the portal site.  Specifically, the "Cookie Exception" page should only have two fields.

1) Cookie name
2) Optional URL path  (by which we would restrict this cookie to only be set when the URL matches this path).

Here's an example:
Cookie: wp-test-cookie
Path: wp-login

These should be stored in arrays within the customer's config file, and will ultimately be turned into VCL that adds this match to the "should we allow this Set-Cookie through, or strip it out" check in vcl_backend_response()

bereq.url ~ "wp-login" && beresp.Set-Cookie ~ "wp-test-cookie"

Most checks are simply to see if a cookie is being set, for example

beresp.Set-Cookie ~ "uniqcookie"

However, for some sites, restricting the path is the only way to get good caching results while allowing log-ins from the appropriate pages.

It's worthy of note that we may want to make this really fine-tunable, so we should support regex characters in the field.

Cookie "^wp-test"
Path: "^/wp-admin"

Read everything from the first stream. When it finishes, you know the command is done.

$stream1= ssh2_exec($connection, 'command to run');
stream_get_contents($stream1); // Wait for command to finish
fclose($stream1);

$stream2 = ssh2_exec($connection, 'command to run 2');
