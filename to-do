So, it could be a separate tab (SSL Domains), or the check-box as mentioned above.

I also think consolidating the "Add domain" and "Remove Domain" tabs could be consolidated with a multi-select radio button and action (delete), with an "add domain" button that pops up 
    a window with a field that allows multiple line-separated domains.

We'll also need a parser for the PEM file to, at a minimum, check for the appropriate BEGIN and END lines in the correct order within the PEM file before posting.

Also within domain edit, the check-boxes should be toggles and not single entry, so that for example, multiple domains can be deleted or purged.

Read everything from the first stream. When it finishes, you know the command is done.

$stream1= ssh2_exec($connection, 'command to run');
stream_get_contents($stream1); // Wait for command to finish
fclose($stream1);

$stream2 = ssh2_exec($connection, 'command to run 2');
